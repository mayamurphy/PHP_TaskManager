# PHP TaskManager | Maya Murphy | 2024

## Summary
This web app is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) app. Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Some extra add-ons are progress bars and stats.

## Purpose
This project reflects my knowledge of full stack development (usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL).

## Notes:
This web app runs locally using WAMP server (https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/).

To host on a server, Dao.php must be updated to reflect this change.

## Run:
1. Start/Run WAMP server 
2. Open a web browser and navigate to: `localhost/TaskManager`
